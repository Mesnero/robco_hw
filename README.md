# ROS2 Hardware Interface for RobCo Industrial Robot

This repository provides a [ROS2 Control hardware interface](https://control.ros.org/rolling/doc/ros2_control/hardware_interface/doc/hardware_components_userdoc.html) for the RobCo industrial robot. It uses the [librobcomm](https://github.com/robco-therobotcompany/librobcomm/tree/master) for communication with the robot.
Currently this HW-Interface offers velocity as a command interface and velocity and position as state interfaces.

## Requirements
- **ROS2**
  [ROS2 Installation Guide](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/)
- **robcomm Library**  
  Installation instructions can be found in the [robcomm repository](https://github.com/robco-therobotcompany/librobcomm/tree/master).
